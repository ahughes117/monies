monies
======

A dead simple money tracker. It is a java application that connects to a mysql database.

To use it, download the Monies.jarr file from downloads, rename it to Monies.jar and import the database from the create.sql script inside the mysql folder.

I would love to hear your ideas in order to add features to it.

As long as I gather some data, I will try to add sums and graphs and fancy stuff like that.
